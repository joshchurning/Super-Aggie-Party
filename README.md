How to compile, run, play our game-----

Compile and run:

Please be on the compute server. (compute.cse.tamu.edu)

Go to right directory -> type in "node server.js" to compile and run. 

This will return back on the console "listening on port ..." where ... is a number the port will be.


Next, go to a webbrowser and type in "compute.cse.tamu.edu:..." where ... is the number you see on the console as stated above. 

After going to our index screen, type in name and click create game. This will create a new lobby and will give a room number so your friend can join. Ask your friend to enter name and room number and click "join game" button. This will now take you to the game where you can start playing.

Enjoy the beta version of our game!

Repo Structure:

We know that the repo at the moment seems messy. However, in the root folder, you will see this README.md file, the server.js file which is the server that will be activated. game.js is the game that will be played (the main board). The only folder you should be looking in is the public folder. The public folder contains all supporting files such as minigame source code, boss source codes, etc. Unfortunately we werent able to completely clean up the repo and this will be done by the next release. 

We appreciate your cooperation.
